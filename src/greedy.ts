/**
 * Greedy
 *
 * Greedy is a tool for fast medical image registration. It was developed by Paul Yushkevich at the Penn Image Computing and Science Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. The motivation for developing greedy was to have a really fast CPU-based deformable image registration tool that could be used in applications where many images have to be registered in parallel - like multi-atlas image segmentation.
 *
 * Greedy borrows many concepts (and some implementation strategies) from the Symmetric Normalization (SyN) in ANTS. But greedy is non-symmetric, which makes it faster (in applications like multi-atlas segmentation, symmetric property is not required). Greedy also uses highly optimized code for image metric computation that adds extra speed.
