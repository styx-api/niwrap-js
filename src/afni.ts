/**
 * AFNI
 *
 * AFNI (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages) is a leading software suite of C, Python, R programs and shell scripts primarily developed for the analysis and display of multiple MRI modalities: anatomical, functional MRI (FMRI) and diffusion weighted (DW) data. It is freely available (both as open source code and as precompiled binaries) for research purposes. The software is made to run on virtually any Unix system with X11 and Motif displays. Binary packages are provided for MacOS and Linux systems such as Fedora, CentOS/Red Hat and Ubuntu (which includes the Windows Subsystem for Linux).
